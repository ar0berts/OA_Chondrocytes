  abstract        = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in the prediction of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP). We synthesized monodisperse gold nanoparticles as SERS-enhanced substrates and analyzed preoperative plasma samples of patients who underwent RP. The roles of clinical risk model (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] score) and distinctive SERS spectra on prediction of early biochemical recurrence were evaluated. The principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) were used to manage the spectral data and develop diagnostic algorithm. A total of 306 preoperative plasma Raman spectra from 102 patients were collected. SERS spectrum from those who developed early biochemical recurrence were compared to those who remained biochemical recurrence-free. The SERS detected more abundant circulating free nucleic acid bases in biochemical recurrence population, presenting significant stronger intensities at SERS spectral bands 725 and 1,328 cm . The addition of Raman spectral peak 1,328 cm  to CAPRA postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score significantly improved the predictive power of logistic regression model compared to simple CAPRA score ( <0.001). Meanwhile, the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the PCA-LDA model and revealed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 65.8%, 87.5%, and 79.4%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of different models. Area under the ROC curve of the CAPRA-S score model alone was 0.77, however, when combined with Raman spectral peak 1,328 cm , it improved to 0.81. Our primary results suggested that SERS could be a meaningful technique for prediction of early biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer.},

In both cases, glass coverslips were used as substrates, due to their wide availability and cost effectiveness. In all sample groups, the same type of behavior was observed, manifested as changes in Raman spectra: the increase of relative intensity of protein/lipid bands and decrease of nucleic acid bands. Comprehensive statistical analysis in the form of principal component analysis was performed, which revealed noticeable grouping of cells with the similar features. Despite the inhomogeneity of primary stem cells and their differentiated lineages, we demonstrated that micro-Raman spectroscopy is sufficient for distinguishing cells' status, which can be valuable for medical and clinical application.},

The injection of autologous platelet rich plasma (aPRP) has been proven to be effective in treating mild knee OA. The effect of injecting aPRP in treating moderate to severe degrees of knee OA remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aPRP in treating patients with at least grade 2 on the Kellgren and Lawrence system for the classification of knee OA using a proteomic approach and clinical evaluation tool of Lequesne index. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was used for accurate needle placement into the knee joint, and to the perimeniscal soft tissue for the injection of aPRP. Three monthly aPRP injections were performed. Group 1 patients received intra-articular (IA) injection only, while group 2 received simultaneous IA and pes anserinus aPRP injections. After two monthly aPRP injections, both groups revealed significant drops in average SF total protein concentrations, and increases in the protein concentrations associated with chelation and anti-aging (eg/transthyretin, matrilin, and complement). However, it is group 2 that revealed significant decreases in the protein concentrations associated with inflammation (eg/immunoglobulin and apolipoprotein), and improved knee functional status. SF appeared to become less susceptible to degeneration after aPRP injections in group 2. As a result, at least 2 monthly injection of IA aPRP in conjunction with accurate injection of aPRP to the perimeniscal soft tissue structure such as the pes anserinus may be a viable option in treating patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.},

OA has been associated with accumulation of senescent cells in or near joints. However, evidence for a causal link between OA and cellular senescence is lacking. Here, we present a novel senescent cell transplantation model involving injection of small numbers of senescent or nonsenescent cells from the ear cartilage of luciferase-expressing mice into the knee joint area of wild-type mice. By using bioluminescence and 18FDG PET imaging, we could track the injected cells in vivo for more than 10 days. Transplanting senescent cells into the knee region caused leg pain, impaired mobility, and radiographic and histological changes suggestive of OA. Transplanting nonsenescent cells had less of these effects. Thus, senescent cells can induce an OA-like state and targeting senescent cells could be a promising strategy for treating OA.},

  abstract        = {Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate in many vertebrate tissues with age and contribute to age-related pathologies, presumably through their secretion of factors contributing to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Removal of SnCs delays several pathologies and increases healthy lifespan. Aging and trauma are risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage leading to pain and physical disability. Senescent chondrocytes are found in cartilage tissue isolated from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, yet their role in disease pathogenesis is unknown. To test the idea that SnCs might play a causative role in OA, we used the p16-3MR transgenic mouse, which harbors a p16  (Cdkn2a) promoter driving the expression of a fusion protein containing synthetic Renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein domains, as well as a truncated form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). This mouse strain allowed us to selectively follow and remove SnCs after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). We found that SnCs accumulated in the articular cartilage and synovium after ACLT, and selective elimination of these cells attenuated the development of post-traumatic OA, reduced pain and increased cartilage development. Intra-articular injection of a senolytic molecule that selectively killed SnCs validated these results in transgenic, non-transgenic and aged mice. Selective removal of the SnCs from in vitro cultures of chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA undergoing total knee replacement decreased expression of senescent and inflammatory markers while also increasing expression of cartilage tissue extracellular matrix proteins. Collectively, these findings support the use of SnCs as a therapeutic target for treating degenerative joint disease.},

In this Review, we summarize current knowledge of SnCs in the multiple tissues that constitute the articular joint. New evidence for the causative role of SnCs in the development of posttraumatic and age-related arthritis is reviewed along with the therapeutic benefit of SnC clearance. As part of their senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SnCs secrete cytokines that impact the immune system and its response to joint tissue trauma. We present concepts of the immune response to tissue trauma as well as the interactions with SnCs and the local tissue environment. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications of targeting SnCs in treating osteoarthritis.},

More recently, the idea that chondrocyte aging is closely associated with the progression of cartilage degeneration has been promulgated. Here, we demonstrate the potential of statin as protective agents against chondrocyte aging and degeneration of articular cartilage during the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), both in vitro and in vivo. The OA-related catabolic factor, IL-1β induced marked downregulation of cellular activity, expression of a senescent biomarker, specific senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and shortening of the cellular lifespan in chondrocytes. In contrast, treatment with statin inhibited the IL-1β-induced production of cartilage matrix degrading .enzymes (metalloprotease-1 and -13) and cellular senescence in of chondrocytes in vitro. In addition, this statin accelerated the production of cartilage matrix proteoglycan in chondrocytes. The in vivo study was performed on the STR/OrtCrlj mouse, an experimental model which spontaneously develops an osteoarthritic process. In this mouse model, treatment with statin significantly reduced the degeneration of articular cartilage, while the control knee joints showed progressive cartilage degeneration over time. These findings suggest that statin may have the potential to prevent the catabolic stress-induced chondrocyte disability and aging observed in articular cartilage. Our results indicate that statin are potential therapeutic agents for protection of articular cartilage against the progression of OA.},

One core reason for this might be a cellular senescence-like phenotype of OA chondrocytes, which might show a fundamentally different behavior pattern unexpected from the biological mechanism established in young cells. This study was designed to investigate one core property of senescent cells, the heterogeneity of gene expression, in OA chondrocytes by double-labeling immunolocalization using two genes (vimentin, S-100 protein) as surrogates, which are constitutively expressed by (normal) chondrocytes. The level of genomic DNA damage in OA chondrocytes was compared to normal chondrocytes and in vitro experiments designed to demonstrate that stochastic genomic DNA damage is able to induce heterogeneity of gene expression in chondrocytes. We show a significantly increased heterogeneity of gene expression for vimentin and S-100 protein as well as a significantly increased genomic DNA damage in the OA compared to normal chondrocytes, whereas no evidence of critical telomere shortening was found. In vitro experiments demonstrated that stochastic genomic DNA damage induced by increased oxidative or genotoxic stress is able to induce the heterogeneity in gene expression found in the OA cells in situ. Our results suggest that OA chondrocytes show a special form of age-related cell degeneration, "progressive/stress-induced senescence", progressing over time due to accumulated DNA damage and subsequent chaotic gene activation pattern. This promotes increased malfunctioning of the cells and finally the loss of their capacity to keep up cell and tissue homeostasis, i.e., prevent OA.},

  abstract      = {Protein silencing is often employed as a means to aid investigations in protein function and is increasingly desired as a therapeutic approach. Several types of protein silencing methodologies have been developed, including targeting the encoding genes, transcripts, the process of translation or the protein directly. Despite these advances, most silencing systems suffer from limitations. Silencing protein expression through genetic ablation, for example by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, is irreversible, time consuming and not always feasible. Similarly, RNA interference approaches warrant prolonged treatments, can lead to incomplete protein depletion and are often associated with off-target effects. Targeted proteolysis has the potential to overcome some of these limitations. The field of targeted proteolysis has witnessed the emergence of many methodologies aimed at targeting specific proteins for degradation in a spatio-temporal manner. In this review, we provide an appraisal of the different targeted proteolytic systems and discuss their applications in understanding protein function, as well as their potential in therapeutics.},

  abstract        = {Arthroscopy is an important diagnostic procedure which can be used in rheumatology practice to provide direct visualization of the joint cavity, permitting macroscopic evaluation of the synovium, sampling for histopathologic and microbiologic examination and the potential therapeutic benefit of lavage. The term 'medical arthroscopy' is used here to refer to arthroscopy performed by rheumatologists for these purposes. This term differentiates arthroscopy performed by orthopedic surgeons for structural interventions such as meniscal debridement and ligament repair. Medical arthroscopy finds a place in rheumatology as an aid to diagnosis, to confirm the presence of synovitis when not expected, to provide histologic or microbiologic diagnosis, and potential stratification for therapy, for example in rheumatoid arthritis, as well as a range of other research purposes. It is performed with local anesthetic using a small bore arthroscope, most usually inserted into the knee, although the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints may also be inspected in this way. In experienced hands it is well tolerated, safe and complications are comparable to those reported by orthopedic surgeons.},
